- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
